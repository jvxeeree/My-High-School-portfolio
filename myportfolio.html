            <h3>Volunteering at Nakornping hospital</h3>
             <p> I volunteered in the emergency department for 80 hours. I learn several skills such as doing the first aid and taking care of patients
              Medical volunteering gave me the opportunity to observe how professional people work and develop a better understanding of their roles.
             </p>
            <h3>Thai department Assistant</h3>
             <p> By the love of thai culture and tradition, I have been helping thai department by organising the events

            <h3>Eye Surgery Mobile unit at Maeloa Hospital</h3>
             <p> In 2023, I went to hospital in Chiangrai and observing the doctors gave the eye operation. this experience gave me a 
              more in depth understanding of why technology 
              is vital in the ongoing care of patients. This experience has also made me even more determined and focused on my dream of studying engineering, 
              as I could visualize how improvements could be made to this technology. 
              These improvements would then ensure patients have access to more advanced health technology that is able to measure patient health data more accurately.
               Overall, this would lead to better treatment and care for patients.</p>
